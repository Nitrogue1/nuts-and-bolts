# Nuts and Bolts
Your team has been hired by the owner of a small hardware store - Nuts and Bolts. Currently, the hardware store does not have a presence on the internet and all orders must be made in person at the hardware store.   Over the next months, the owner would like a website put in place so that people will be able to find them on the internet. The owner would like users to be able to create a shopping cart of all the items they would like to purchase. The users should be able to print out the shopping cart so that they can bring it to the store and have it filled by a clerk. The owner would like to be able to add and remove inventory that the users see on the site. There are a few online reports that the owner would like to see also. The store owner would like the team to take an iterative approach to this project.
